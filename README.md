# netseccheck

Network Security Checker with Alexa

This project was originally assigned at IT/Dev Connection 2017 as the hack-a-thon project.  Our team had great intentions of working on this project but spent more time getting to know San Francisco and each other.  However, we decided we would complete the project eventually.

There is a windows service located here https://github.com/geo101/netseccheck-winservice for manipulating a csv file of windows events.  The service creates the data needed by the alexa skill.
